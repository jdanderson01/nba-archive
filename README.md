# nba-archive

A work-in-progress site that takes the NBA's color scheme and applies it to a fictional "NBA Archive" landing page. Currently made for desktop with some mobile responsiveness. Also working on getting the images to display on Github pages.

Here's a working Netlify deploy of the site: https://enchanting-kashata-e1ce25.netlify.app
